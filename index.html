        Hi ma'am,<br>

        I apologize for the inconvenience. I encountered issues with the deployment on Vercel for Week 6 and was unable to redo it as I had already submitted the link.
        It took some time to troubleshoot, and with the due date approaching, I needed to submit it on time. I am sorry for any trouble this has caused. Below, 
        I am providing the working and new link for Week 6 that has been deployed.

    </p>
